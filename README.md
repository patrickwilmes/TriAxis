# TriAxis
This project implements a 3D renderer in C++.

## Why am I doing this
Implementing a 3D renderer touches many different concerns, starting from linear algebra, over data structures, algorithms, opengl and
low level programming, as well as also concerning software architecture and such. So my goal is not to implement the most advanced
renderer or such, but rather to train those abilities mentioned, by project based learning.
